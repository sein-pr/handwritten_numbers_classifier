# Handwritten Numbers Classifier
This project implements a classifier for handwritten digits using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and regression techniques with TensorFlow. The model is designed to accurately recognize and classify images of handwritten numbers, showcasing advanced capabilities in pattern recognition and machine learning.

## Project Overview
The handwritten numbers classifier is built to tackle the challenge of identifying digits from handwritten images. This project utilizes MLP, a type of artificial neural network, along with regression methods to enhance the model's prediction accuracy. The classifier is trained and evaluated using the popular MNIST dataset.

## Features
- __Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)__: Utilizes MLP architecture for deep learning.
- __Regression Techniques__: Applies regression methods for improved classification.
- __TensorFlow__: Implements the model using the TensorFlow framework.
- __Accuracy__: Achieves high accuracy in digit recognition.
- __MNIST Dataset__: Employs the MNIST dataset for training and testing.
