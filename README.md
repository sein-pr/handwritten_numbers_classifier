# Handwritten Numbers Classifier
This project implements a classifier for handwritten digits using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and regression techniques with TensorFlow. The model is designed to accurately recognize and classify images of handwritten numbers, showcasing advanced capabilities in pattern recognition and machine learning.

## Project Overview
The handwritten numbers classifier is built to tackle the challenge of identifying digits from handwritten images. This project utilizes MLP, a type of artificial neural network, along with regression methods to enhance the model's prediction accuracy. The classifier is trained and evaluated using the popular MNIST dataset.
